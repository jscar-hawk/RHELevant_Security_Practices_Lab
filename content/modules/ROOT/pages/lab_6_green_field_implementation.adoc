== Green Field Implementation

Lab Length
Medium/Average (~20-30 mins)

Goal
Get the step for the most control to build a new RHEL machine with hardneing

== 6.0 Where do I start?

If you have the opertunity to start fresh with a new install for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9,
you will want to start with your standard RHEL 9 image. This is sometimes called a golden or base image. 

To help us automation the install process, we will create something called a kickstart file.
This can also be called an anwser file, anaconda file or install template.

So there are a lot of ways to get started.
This will depend on your orginization needs.
Some folks will only be able to use a DVD to install a single machines and others my be able install a whole rack of machines at a time.

== 6.1 Download RHEL ISO

In the most basic setup you can start with the https://access.redhat.com/downloads/content/479/ver=/rhel---9/9.4/x86_64/product-software[RHEL 9 install media].

== 6.2 Create a bootable USB Drive

Then you can create a bootable USB Drive

== 6.3 Advanced RHEL installs 

We have multiple guides on different methods of https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/9/html/performing_a_standard_rhel_9_installation/installation-methods-advanced_installing-rhel[install methods for RHEL 9]

== 6.4 Customize your kickstart file

Assuming you go with the basic media and choose the hardning frameworks like DISA STIGs for RHEL 9 GUI. After you have installed RHEL for the first time there will be a template created under `/root/anacanda-ks.cfg`.

You can save this file and us it as a template.

From here you have  a few different ways to create, change or modify a kickstart file for the install on your other machines.

* https://access.redhat.com/labs/kickstartconfig/[Kickstart Generator via browser]
* You can also check out https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/linux-golden-homelab-rhel[Image Builder via Web Console]

After you have create a new kick start you can add it to a custom RHEL install media.

== 6.5 Harden your machines

For New Installs

* RHEL Installer 
* Image Builder

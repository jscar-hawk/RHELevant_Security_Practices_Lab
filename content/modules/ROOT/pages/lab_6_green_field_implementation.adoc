== Green Field Implementation

=== 6.0 Where do I start?

If you have the opertunity to start fresh with a new install for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9,
you will want to start with your standard RHEL 9 image. This is sometimes called a golden or base image. 

To help us automation the install process, we will create something called a kickstart file.
This can also be called an anwser file, anaconda file or install template.

In the most basic setup you can start with the https://access.redhat.com/downloads/content/479/ver=/rhel---9/9.4/x86_64/product-software[RHEL 9 install media].

Then you can create a bootable USB Drive

We have some guides on different guides on https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/9/html/performing_a_standard_rhel_9_installation/installation-methods-advanced_installing-rhel[install methods for RHEL 9]


Assuming you go with the basic media and choose the hardning frameworks like DISA STIGs for RHEL 9 GUI. After you have installed RHEL for the first time there will be a template created under `/root/anacanda-ks.cfg`.

You can save this file and 









Where can you get the RHEL 9 STIG?
For Existing RHEL Instances

* pre-built Ansible Playbooks 
* OpenSCAP scanner
* Red Hat Insights 
* Red Hat Satellite


For New Installs

* RHEL Installer 
* Image Builder

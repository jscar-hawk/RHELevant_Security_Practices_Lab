== Install and setup Ansible for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9

If you use Ansible content within Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), 
you should know that important changes where made with RHEL 8.6 and 9.0.

RHEL 7 and RHEL 8.0-8.5 customers have access to a separate Ansible Engine repository. 

In RHEL 8.6 and 9.0, customers will have access to Ansible Core, which will be included in the corresponding AppStream repository. 

The move to Ansible Core in RHEL is being made to adapt to changes in the Ansible project.

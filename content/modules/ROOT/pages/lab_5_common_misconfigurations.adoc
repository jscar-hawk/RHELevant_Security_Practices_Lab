Ok enough of theory;

The most common issues boiled down are in the following categories:

=== 5.1 Weak Passwords

In the past you would check the password with 'pam_cracklib', but this should not be used in RHEL 9.

=== 5.2 Permission Issue

For the next steps, as Linux Sys-Admin's we understand there are a handful of places we can look for users on the systems and thier permissions.

In this lab we are assuming we are on a machine with local acccounts (Not hooked to an LDAP or AD system).

We need to check the common files connected to an account.

* /etc/users
* /etc/group
* /etc/sudoers
* /etc/shadow
* /etc/passwd
* /home/*
* /etc/cron*

Unused accounts with certain privileges are not being deleted.


=== 5.3 Service Misconfiguration

=== 5.4 Neglecting Updates

=== 5.5

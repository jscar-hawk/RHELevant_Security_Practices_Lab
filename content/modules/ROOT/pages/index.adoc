Welcome to {lab_name}! We hope you're ready for a dive into security practices with a couple of techies who love to talk about Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)!

== Why is this lab important?

We're glad you asked. 

RHEL is packed with security features that dont just make you or your administrators sleep better at night, they help you hit those compliance check-lists that we know matter so much to your CISO. 

RHEL is a great platform right out of the box, but we can't make all the security decisions for you.  So the base RHEL installation is only hardened to the point where we think it's a great base for you to customise to meet your needs.  In this lab we're going to walk you through some practical examples of many of these features, so you can get your hands dirty and see how they work and what benefits they bring. 

== What will we cover?

In today's lab, we are going to take you down several roads. 

* Default to secure posture
* Use strong, trusted crypo starting at install time
* System wide crypto policy
* Trusted source of packages and updates
* Firewall installed and configured
* Disable Unnecessary Services
* Use Strong Password Policies
* Use SSH Key Auth
* Audit Logging (rsyslog server)‚óè
* Filesystem Security (With common misconfigs as examples)
* Monitoring and Intrusion Detection
* Backups (backup server)
* Least Privilege (sudo rules)
* Automate Security Framework (STIGs with openSCAP)

== Lab Access

The terminal window to your right is *already* logged into the lab environment as the `{ssh_user}` user via `ssh`. 
All steps of this lab are to be completed as the `{ssh_user}` user.

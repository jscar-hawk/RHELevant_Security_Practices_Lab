Welcome to {lab_name}! We hope you're ready for a dive into security practices with a couple of techies who love to talk about Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)!

== Why is this lab important?

We're glad you asked. 

RHEL is packed with security features that dont just make you or your administrators sleep better at night, they help you hit those compliance check-lists that we know matter so much to your CISO. 

RHEL is a great platform right out of the box, but we can't make all the security decisions for you.  So the base RHEL installation is only hardened to the point where we think it's a great base for you to customise to meet your needs.  In this lab we're going to walk you through some practical examples of many of these features, so you can get your hands dirty and see how they work and what benefits they bring. 

== What will we cover?

In today's lab, we are going to take you down the path to better understand your lab, 
the status of the machines, and how then to make them more secure then before.

* Lab 1 RHPDS Lab Setup
** Lab 1 alt KVM for Local testing
* Lab 2 Ansible 101
* Lab 3 Creating a system baseline
* Lab 4 Theory, Threats, and Tools
* Lab 5 Common Misconfigurations
* Lab 6 Green Field Implementation
* Lab 7 Web Console Administration

=== Lab Access

The terminal window to your right is *already* logged into the lab environment as the `lab-user` user via `ssh`. 
All steps of this lab are to be completed as the `lab-user` user on the bastion server.

You should be able to click the clipboard icon in the code box to copy the command, and you will eather use the middle mouse button or right click and paste.
The keyboard shortcuts for copy and paste (ctrl+c and ctrl+v) wont't work in this.

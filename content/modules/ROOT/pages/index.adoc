Welcome to {lab_name}! We hope you're ready for a dive into security practices with a couple of techies who love to talk about Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)!

== Why is this lab important?

We're glad you asked. 

RHEL is packed with security features that dont just make you or your administrators sleep better at night, they help you hit those compliance check-lists that we know matter so much to your CISO. 

RHEL is a great platform right out of the box, but we can't make all the security decisions for you.  So the base RHEL installation is only hardened to the point where we think it's a great base for you to customise to meet your needs.  In this lab we're going to walk you through some practical examples of many of these features, so you can get your hands dirty and see how they work and what benefits they bring. 

== What will we cover?

In today's lab, we are going to take you down several roads. 

* Lab Setup
** KVM for Local Testing
** Ansible 101
* Theory, Threats, and Tools
* Creating a system baseline
* Common Misconfigurations
* Exploitation & Mitigation

=== Lab Access

The terminal window to your right is *already* logged into the lab environment as the `{ssh_user}` user via `ssh`. 
All steps of this lab are to be completed as the `{ssh_user}` user on the bastion server.

To access the IdM GUI once you have installed it in `Step 1`, you will need to open a browser, go to settings, type "proxy" in the search bar in the top right corner and click settings. Select "Manual proxy configuration" and go to "SOCKS Host" and put in localhost and for the "Port" put in 5060. Finally check the checkbox for "Proxy DNS when using SOCKS v5".

Finally you will need to open a terminal window and run `{socks_ssh_command}` using the password `{admin_pass}`.

== 7.1 Install Web Console

We are going to install Cockpit AKA Web Console, on our bastion machine, which gives us a website to admin our linux system.

Open a terminal on your host machine, and type

[source,ini,role=execute,subs=attributes+]
----
sudo yum install cockpit -y
----

Later in the instructions we will start the service with the command below.
We are leaving it off for now to opimize your machine resources.

[source,ini,role=execute,subs=attributes+]
----
sudo systemctl enable --now cockpit.socket
----
